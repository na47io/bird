# üê¶ Bird

Bird is an open-source microblogging platform that emphasizes simplicity and user privacy. It's designed for personal use, allowing posts of 140 characters or less to express thoughts without the social pressure of content curation.

## Why Bird?

- Focusing on personal thoughts rather than social sharing
- Removing the pressure to appear cooler or more knowledgeable
- Eliminating the need for content curation
- Providing a space for authentic self-expression

## Features

- 140-character limit for concise expression
- Hashtag support for organizing thoughts
- Simple, clean interface
- User authentication and privacy controls
- Reply functionality for self-dialogue
- Search capabilities across posts and replies
